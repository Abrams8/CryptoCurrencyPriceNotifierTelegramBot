Hi! This application is working now. You can find and test it in the **Telegram** application, just write **@cryptoCurrencyPriceNotifierBot** ( or tap the link https://t.me/cryptoCurrencyPriceNotifierBot ).
The application helps you follow cryptocurrencies, which you interested in, set prices and directions, and when real price will be the same as your price (more or less, it depends on direction), you will receive a notification about it.


After **/start** command your telegram id will be added to the database and you can start working with the bot.

Write **/rules** to get more information on how to use the bot, or read next lines).


If you want to follow a coin, just use:

id90+45000 or id90-41000

where 90 - coin ID*, plus(+) or minus(-) - direction, and the last number is price which you want to follow :)


Bot uses API from www.coinlore.com website. Every 5 second bot gets info about current prices and saves it to the database.

*coin IDs you can find on www.coinlore.com website (chose coin and find API ID).

**Have a nice day! :)**
